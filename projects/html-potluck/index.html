    <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Dried chiles:</b> You need guajillo chiles, ancho chiles, and arbol chiles. You can 
            find them in the international foods aisle of your local grocery store or at all 
            Hispanic grocery stores. If you can’t find them in your area, buying them online 
            is always a great option. If you’ve never worked with dried chiles before, I’ve got 
            your back. Step by step instructions are in the recipe card below. You can also read 
            this detailed birria post for more.</li>
        <li><b>Spices and bay leaves:</b> I used a combination of garlic, cumin, ground clove, Mexican oregano, 
            Mexican cinnamon stick (also called Ceylon cinnamon), black peppercorns, and 3 bay leaves. If 
            you don’t have Mexican oregano, you can use regular oregano. If you can’t find Mexican cinnamon 
            sticks (they’re the brittle kind that you can easily break in half), you can use 2 teaspoons 
            of ground cinnamon.</li>
        <li><b>Meat:</b> I used a beef chuck roast to make my birria. It’s got a great fat-to-meat ratio and 
            creates the perfect layer of fat needed to fry the tortillas to make birria tacos. Birria is traditionally made 
            with goat or lamb meat, but that’s not readily available where I live, so I opted for beef. Other options 
            also include short ribs, beef shanks, and oxtail for added flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Corn tortillas:</b> Corn tortillas that you can get just about at any grocery store are perfect! Of course, 
            you can always make your own homemade corn tortillas if you’re feeling fancy. </li>
        <li><b>Shredded cheese:</b> Traditional Mexican melting cheeses like Oaxacan (quesillo), Chihuahua, and Asadero are the 
            best options, but you could also use Monterey Jack or Mozzarella if you can’t find those near you.</li>
        <li><b>Cilantro, diced white onions, and lime wedges:</b> Must-have toppings that pair perfectly 
            with the rich and fatty birria!</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>DIRECTIONS</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the birria. Season and sear the meat on both sides. Then soak the chiles, blend 
            them until smooth, and strain the sauce into a pot with the seared meat. Bring everything 
            to a boil, then turn the heat to low, cover, and cook for 3-3 ½ hours until the meat 
            is fall-apart tender. Take the meat out and shred it with two forks.</li>
        <li>Dip both sides of a corn tortilla in the layer of fat that sits on top of the 
            pot of birria. Try to only dip into this top layer and not further down into the 
            red broth or consomé.</li>
        <li>Fry the tortilla in a large skillet over medium-high heat. It should begin bubbling 
            immediately. Top half of the tortilla with a generous amount of shredded cheese and 
            shredded birria meat.</li>
        <li>Fold the other half of the tortilla over to create a taco, and cook for 1 minute on 
            each side until the cheese has fully melted and the tortillas have crisped up.</li>
    </ol>
