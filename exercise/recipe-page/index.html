    <h1>MAKING THE CAKE</h1>
    <p>The best part about loaf cakes is how easy they are to make! It comes 
        together so quickly and can even be whipped up all in one bowl. Let’s 
        break it apart into two sections, the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients.</p>
    <p>Here is what you need for the dry ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>baking powder</li>
        <li>baking soda</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>lemon instant pudding</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>THE GLAZE</h1>
    <p>Learning how to make a glaze is a great recipe to have under your belt if you 
        love to bake a lot! It can be drizzled on cakes, cookies, donuts, and so much more. 
        The best part is it usually only needs two ingredients at its core and then you 
        can add in other optional ingredients to bring in different flavors. Here is 
        what you need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>confectioners sugar</li>
        <li>lemon juice</li>
        <li>whole milk</li>
