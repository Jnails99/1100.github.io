            <h1>Final Fantasy VI</h1>
            <hr>
            <P>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</P>
            <p>Final Fantasy VI,[a] also known as Final Fantasy 
                III from its initial North American release, is a 
                1994 role-playing video game developed and published 
                by Square for the Super Nintendo Entertainment 
                System. It is the sixth main entry in the Final 
                Fantasy series, the final to feature 2D sprite based 
                graphics, and the first to be directed by someone 
                other than series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role 
                was instead filled by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. </p>
            <p>Set in a world with technology resembling the Second 
                Industrial Revolution, the game's story follows an 
                expanding cast that includes fourteen permanent playable 
                characters. The narrative deals with the themes of a 
                rebellion against an immoral military dictatorship, 
                pursuit of a magical arms race, use of chemical 
                weapons in warfare, depictions of violent and 
                apocalyptic confrontations, several personal 
                redemption arcs, teenage pregnancy, and the 
                renewal of hope and life itself.</p>
            <p>It was ported by Tose with minor differences to the 
                PlayStation in 1999, and the Game Boy Advance in 2006. 
                The Super NES version was rereleased for the Wii's 
                Virtual Console in 2011, and by Nintendo as part of 
                the company's Super NES Classic Edition in 2017.[1] 
                The game was known as Final Fantasy III when it was 
                first released in North America, as the original Final 
                Fantasy II, III, and V had not been released outside 
                Japan at the time (leaving IV as the second title 
                released outside Japan and VI as the third). However, 
                all later versions of the game, other than re-releases 
                of the original version, use the original title.</p>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Like previous installments, Final Fantasy VI consists of 
                four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and 
                dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The 
                overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's world, 
                which the player uses to direct characters to various 
                locations. As with most games in the series, the three 
                primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, 
                chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, 
                enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the 
                overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where 
                the player makes such decisions as which characters will 
                be in the traveling party, which equipment they wield, 
                the magic they learn, and the configuration of the 
                gameplay. It is also used to track experience points 
                and levels.[2]</p>
            <p>The game's plot develops as the player progresses through 
                towns and dungeons. Town citizens will offer helpful 
                information, and some residents own item or equipment 
                shops. Later in the game, visiting certain towns will 
                activate side-quests. Dungeons appear as a variety of 
                areas, including caves, forests, and buildings. These 
                dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare 
                items that are not available in most stores. Dungeons 
                may feature puzzles and mazes, with some dungeons 
                requiring the player to divide the characters into 
                multiple parties which must work together to advance 
                through the dungeon.[2]</p>
