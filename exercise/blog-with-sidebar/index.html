            <h1>Marvel Cinematic Universe</h1>
            <hr>
            <h4>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4>
            <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media 
                franchise and shared universe centered on a series of 
                superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are 
                based on characters that appear in American comic books published 
                by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series, 
                short films, digital series, and literature. The shared universe, 
                much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was 
                established by crossing over common plot elements, 
                settings, cast, and characters.</p>
            <p>Marvel Studios releases its films in groups called 
                "Phases", with the first three phases collectively 
                known as "The Infinity Saga" and the following three 
                phases as "The Multiverse Saga". The first MCU film, 
                Iron Man (2008), began Phase One which culminated 
                in the 2012 crossover film The Avengers. Phase Two 
                began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and concluded with 
                Ant-Man (2015), while Phase Three began with 
                Captain America: Civil War (2016) and concluded 
                with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019).</p>

            <h3>Marvel Studios films and series</h3>
            <h4>The Infinity Saga films</h4>
            <p>By 2005, Marvel Entertainment was planning to 
                produce its own films independently and distribute 
                them through Paramount Pictures.[2] Previously, 
                Marvel had co-produced several superhero films 
                based on Marvel Comics with Columbia Pictures, New 
                Line Cinema, 20th Century Fox, and others.[3] 
                Marvel made relatively little profit from these 
                licensing deals and wanted to get more money 
                out of its films while maintaining artistic 
                control of the projects and distribution.[4] Avi 
                Arad, head of Marvel Entertainment's film division, 
                was pleased with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films 
                at Sony Pictures but was less pleased with some 
                of the other films. Arad decided to form Marvel 
                Studios, Hollywood's first major independent film 
                studio since DreamWorks Pictures was founded in 1994.</p>
